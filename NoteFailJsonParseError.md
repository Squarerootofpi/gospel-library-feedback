I can no longer edit a certain note in my gospel library notes on the web.

I have noticed this error happens at different times, and the response body is as follows: 

```
<html><body><center><h1><b>Not Available</b></h1><i>This page is unavailable.  Error code: 2-1919</i></center></body></html>
```

Other times that this error often occurs (or something like it) is when I copy and paste a url that has the improper &lang=eng rather than the ?lang=eng as a query parameter in the url. For some reason, urls like that in the gospel library note causes it to break the json.

The request (in the form of a fetch) is shown below. I have hard refreshed my browser: google chrome, which is up to date with the latest version.
